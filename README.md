# Data Visualization: Fatalities in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (2000–2023)

---

## About

This is a course project submitted as part of my **Data Visualization** course during my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology (Hons) in Internet of Things at Universiti Kuala Lumpur (2021 – 2025).

The project analyzes a public dataset of fatalities in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from 2000 to 2023, compiled by Willian Oliveira Gibin and available under the CC0 license. Using Tableau, the data is explored across five dimensions — trends over time, demographics, geography, circumstances, and ammunition types.

## Quick Preview

| Analysis Area | What it covers |
|---|---|
| Trends over time | Annual fatalities from 2000–2023, Palestinian vs. Israeli breakdown |
| Demographics | Age distribution, child fatalities, gender breakdown |
| Geography | Fatalities by residence district, event location, and map view |
| Circumstances | Combatant vs. non-combatant fatalities, responsible parties |
| Ammunition | Types of ammunition used and their geographical distribution |

All visualizations were built in **Tableau Desktop**.
